#include <SparkFun_MAG3110.h>

MAG3110 mag = MAG3110(); //Instantiate MAG3110

void setup() {

  Serial.begin(9600);

  Wire.begin(); //setup I2C bus
  Wire.setClock(400000);    // I2C fast mode, 400kHz
  
  mag.initialize();
  //This line makes the output data rate a lot slower
  //Output Data Rate = 1.25Hz
  //Oversampling Ratio = 32
  //This means it takes 32 samples and averages the results
  if(!mag.error) //You can use this to check if there was an error during initialization.
  {
    mag.setDR_OS(MAG3110_DR_OS_1_25_32);
    mag.start();
  }

  //You can set your own offsets without calibration
  //mag.setOffset(MAG3110_X_AXIS, -100);
  //mag.setOffset(MAG3110_Y_AXIS, 300);
  //mag.setOffset(MAG3110_Z_AXIS, -300);

  //You can read the sensor's offset by calling:
  //int offset = mag.readOffset(MAG3110_X_AXIS);

  //You can obtain system information by calling any of the following:
  //mag.isActive(); //Tells you whether the mag sensor is active or in standby
  //mag.isRaw(); //Tells you if the mag sensor is outputting raw data or not
  //mag.isCalibrated(); //Tells you if the mag sensor has been calibrated
  //mag.isCalibrating(); //Tells you if the mag sensor is currently being calibrated
  //uint8_t mode = mag.getSysMode(); //Reads the SYSMOD register. See the datasheet for more information

  //This will reset the sensor to default values
  //It sets the offsets to 0, flags it as uncalibrated, and sets the device to standby mode
  //The Output Data Rate and Oversampling ratio will also be set to 80 and 16 respectively (see datasheet)
  //mag.reset();

  //This will disable the use of user offsets
  //User offsets are enabled by default but are initialized to 0
  //mag.rawData(true);

  float xf, yf, zf;
  //Only read data when it's ready

    Serial.print(yf);
